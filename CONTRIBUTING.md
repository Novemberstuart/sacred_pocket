# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help with the Sacred Pocket App! As we want this to be a full-featured, beautiful, and easy to use tool to create virtual sacred spaces, there's a lot of work that needs to be done!

## Guidelines

We know that the world of programming and the world of witchcraft and spiritual practices don't often mix-- so please, if you're here to judge our beliefs, keep it to yourself. There are plenty of other spaces in which you can question the validity of witchcraft, pagan, and spiritual beliefs. The only people we want working on this project are those who can be properly respectful of the fact that everyone has a right to their own belief system.

Keeping that in mind, we also want to be respectful of the great diversity in the witchcraft community. This means not using language, artwork, or anything else that is cultural appropriation, homophobic, transphobic, or racist. In the app, the gender-neutral pronouns 'they' and 'them' (even for the singular) should be used whenever possible, if necessary. Terms in reference to closed practices will not be used. [This](https://miriamcumming.com/list-of-practices-appropriated-by-wicca/) is a good reference list of some closed practices.

In light of that, we want to note that this app <b>will</b> be incorporating tarot cards. Some argue that tarot cards are a closed practice, as the Romani people were historically persecuted for their use of the tarot. Others argue that tarot originated in Italy merely as playing cards. We have decided to include tarot cards in this app, as they are a vital part of many people's practice and should not be considered offensive when used in a respectful way.
