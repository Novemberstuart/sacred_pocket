# sacred_pocket

Sacred Pocket is an app for witches, pagans, occultists, spiritualists, and everyone in between to create virtual altars that they can carry with them anywhere, through collecting pixel art depictions of common ritual items such as crystals, herbs, and tarot cards. 

## Where Can I Get It?

Sacred Pocket is not yet available on the app store as it is still in development. Feel free to download and test out the code, however!

## Contributing
